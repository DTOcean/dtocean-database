# The DTOcean Database

The DTOcean Database is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
for storing persistent data, such as ocean energy converter (OEC) designs, 
metocean observations for sites, and reference data for electrical, mooring
and foundations components, ports, vessels, etc.

The database backup stored in this repository contains free to use examples of
OECs, sites, and reference data.
